This is a checkout of the jsonrpclib library for use within the
factory repository only, since it conflicts with some autotest code.

It was copied from the existing jsonrpclib package:

  https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromeos-mirror/gentoo/distfiles/jsonrpclib-0_pre20110820.tar.bz2

and patched with

  third_party/portage-stable/dev-python/jsonrpclib/files/jsonrpclib-fix-nested-imports.patch
