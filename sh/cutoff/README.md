ChromeOS Factory Cut-off scripts
--------------------------------
The scripts here are dedicated for Chrome OS Factory Software, for the process
of turning off the device for packaging.

This folder is shared by Chrome OS Factory Toolkit (complete execution
enviroment with Python) and Factory Reset Shim (also known as factory_install
image, using a very limited root file system without Python) so it must not have
any dependency with other files outside this folder.
