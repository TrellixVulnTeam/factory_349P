TEST LISTS
==========
On startup, goofy imports all modules in this package (except for
generic.py) in alphabetical order.  The CreateTestLists() function is
invoked in each module that has one.

generic.py is loaded *last*, and only if no other module has created
a test list called "main" (i.e., there is no board-specific test list
in the overlay).

Old-style test lists are also loaded from
/usr/local/factory/test_lists.

THE ACTIVE TEST LIST
====================
If a file called ACTIVE is present in this directory, it contains the
ID of the active test list.  So, for example, to activate the "manual_smt"
test list on a device:

  echo manual_smt > /usr/local/factory/py/test/test_lists/ACTIVE

If no ACTIVE file is present, the "main" test list is used.

(Note that ACTIVE is a file, not a symlink to a file as in the past.)

IGNORED TEST LISTS
==================
If a file called IGNORE is present in this directory, it contains a list
of all test list modules that should be ignored.  (For our purposes, the
"module name" is equivalent to the Python file name without its ".py"
extension.)  Test list module names are separated by spaces.  This might
be used if we have a particular test list which currently exhibits errors
or exceptions (which Goofy will show on startup), but which we may want to
fix and use in the future.

So, for example, to ignore the two test lists "generic_rrt" and
"generic_vswr" on a device:

  echo "generic_rrt generic_vswr" > /usr/local/factory/py/test/test_lists/IGNORE

If no IGNORE file is present, all test lists will be read by Goofy.

(Just like ACTIVE, IGNORE is also a regular file.)
