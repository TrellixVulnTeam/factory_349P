author "Chromium OS Authors <chromium-os-dev@chromium.org>"

# Task start conditions:
start on filesystem

# all-umpire.conf starts each umpire daemon with board environ var. And itself
# is a short-run task that ends itself.
task

# Connects standard input to /dev/null. Standard output and standard error are
# connected to one end of a pseudo-terminal such that any job output is
# automatically logged to a file in directory /var/log/upstart/ .
