* Instructions for deploying on Google App Engine:
We need a Google API Service Account's PEM key on GAE.

Generate and download the PKCS12 format private key from API console, and
execute `openssl pkcs12 -in privatekey.p12 -nodes -nocerts > privatekey.pem`
to convert the key from PKCS12 to PEM. Then manually delete anything before
"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" from privatekey.pem.

Use dump_db.py to dump all datas to json files, and upload them with schemas
in the directory schemas/ to Google BigQuery tables. The tables must be named
Device, Test, Event, Component (case sensitive)

Copy settings_bigquery.py.TEMPLATE to settings_bigquery.py, and set the settings
accordingly.

Copy app.yaml.TEMPLATE to app.yaml, and change the application name to the real
application name deploying to.
