This folder contains implementations for different boards.

To add your own class, inherit from one board and override your Device
properties:

 from cros.factory.device import board
 from cros.factory.device import component
 from cros.factory.device import power

 class MyPower(power.Power):
   def CheckACPresent(self):
     return False

 class MyBoard(board.DeviceBoard):

   @component.DeviceProperty
   def power(self):
     return MyPower(self)
