gooftool, "Google Factory Tool", is a standalone program that was intended to
provide and support all Google required ChromeOS specific manufacturing flow,
including:

 - Enable and check write protection.
 - Leave and check developer mode.
 - Wipe manufacturing data.
 - Verify hardware configuration and setup right Hardware ID.
 - Ensure ChromeOS image version, channel, and digital signing keys.
 - Sanity check Vital Product Data (VPD).

Since it's very specific to ChromeOS, may need to run on a pure test image
without standard ChromeOS factory software environment, and should not allow
arbitrary modification, it's carefully designed that

  - Gootfool should not use Factory Test or DUT API.
  - Gooftool may only import HWID, test environment and schema (rules), or
             shared utils.

For devices running station mode, gooftool is executed on DUT directly instead
of using DUT API.
